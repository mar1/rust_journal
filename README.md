# Rustcean August

**Hello, frens. My name is Marin and I’m discreetly committing to learning Rust through at least 1-month detailed learning experience.**

As I was talking with my brother recently, discipline is key in everything we try to accomplish. That’s why I’m starting here. **We’re Sunday, the 30th of July 2023 and I yet don’t know if it’s the beginning of something.**

For the context/background, I’m a full-stack web3 developer. However, I mostly use JS and Solidity daily. I deploy most of my code on Moonbeam/Moonbase as I like the spirit of this chain. You have access to great tools and the EVM compatibility is top-notch. Also, you have the entire Substrate ecosystem accessible through XCM.

**And Rust is behind this. That’s also why I’m stepping up my game today.**

Finally, after meeting someone from _Parity_ at _parisDOT.comm_ and talking with my co-founders, I believe taking part in the next _Polkadot Builders Academy_ could make a lot of sense. However, the requirements are high, that’s why I should better start now.

# Where to start

I've got quite a good list of ressources to start with. I'm a digger. I like to bookmark and collect good ressources until I really need them. I often, like everyone I guess, forget about them.
But this project is obviously about trying to learn with efficience.
So here are my Rust ressources:

1) [The Rust Book](https://cwcmy04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/I6+113/cWcMY04/VVBZhr8TdrFtW14Hskx1yL1ghW1sXT7r4WQT9bN5l4bjp3q8_QV1-WJV7CgBjxW504CnP6SGrw6N4NvpWZNVVTZW2nm8622tlh9LW99Sdkd7_Q50LW566V6G6TqLLQW80bkj21FhsdSW6BfqL14HCJssW3SFcvc2KdlD0W71MBcP7tWstyW7PHg3D8WvZS3Vmq1qJ3WJgVkW62dkBZ5vQWBbW4_rTLZ8Vs21JW8rBpCH7RWD5XW1P9G9F1KnbkMW4jFRwb7tjhLCN5xb9lNN4cm8W6J2cHf28SdBMN3lz3lvvl4nLN2jLjMcB9p2zVT6K6q7ZKlyCW8lg3ch5V10kP3q4q1)
