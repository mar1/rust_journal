# Rustcean August

**Hello, frens. My name is Marin and I’m discreetly committing to learning Rust through at least 1-month detailed learning experience.**

As I was talking with my brother recently, discipline is key in everything we try to accomplish. That’s why I’m starting here. **We’re Sunday, the 30th of July 2023 and I yet don’t know if it’s the beginning of something.**

For the context, my name is Marin and I’m a full-stack web3 developer. However, I mostly use JS and Solidity daily. I deploy most of my code on Moonbeam/Moonbase as I like the spirit of this chain. You have access to great tools and the EVM compatibility is top-notch. Also, you have the entire Substrate ecosystem accessible through XCM.

**And Rust is behind this. That’s also why I’m stepping up my game today.**

Finally, after meeting someone from _Parity_ at _parisDOT.comm_ and talking with my co-founders, I believe taking part in the next _Polkadot Builders Academy_ could make a lot of sense. However, the requirements are high, that’s why I should better start now.

# Where to start

I've got quite a good list of ressources to start with. I'm a digger. I like to bookmark and collect good ressources until I really need them. I often, like everyone I guess, forget about them.
But this project is obviously about trying to learn with efficience.
So here are my Rust ressources:

1) [The Rust Book](https://cwcmy04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/I6+113/cWcMY04/VVBZhr8TdrFtW14Hskx1yL1ghW1sXT7r4WQT9bN5l4bjp3q8_QV1-WJV7CgBjxW504CnP6SGrw6N4NvpWZNVVTZW2nm8622tlh9LW99Sdkd7_Q50LW566V6G6TqLLQW80bkj21FhsdSW6BfqL14HCJssW3SFcvc2KdlD0W71MBcP7tWstyW7PHg3D8WvZS3Vmq1qJ3WJgVkW62dkBZ5vQWBbW4_rTLZ8Vs21JW8rBpCH7RWD5XW1P9G9F1KnbkMW4jFRwb7tjhLCN5xb9lNN4cm8W6J2cHf28SdBMN3lz3lvvl4nLN2jLjMcB9p2zVT6K6q7ZKlyCW8lg3ch5V10kP3q4q1)

# Day 1

## Some setup things

As when any story starts, the future looks bright.
I started from the roots wit _The Rust Book_ chapters 1-2-3.
Installation is super simple on mac, to be honest. Just a simple one-liner:

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

Migh also need a C compiler by adding

    code-select --install
You can check if everything went smoothly by doing

    rustc --version

If you have troubles with your `%PATH%` after running the previous command (meaning rust is not recognized), please check this [stackoverflow's link.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67656028/rustup-gives-command-not-found-error-with-zsh-even-after-installing-with-brew)

Ok now we can create some `main.rs` file and put some code int it:

```rust
fn main() { println!("Hello, world!"); }
```

Hello, world! Nothing very surprising for the code above, expect the ! after the function's name. Actually, that's because `println` is not a function but a

> macro

I guess I learn more later about them.
Big things here coming from JS/Node is the compilation step. Not that big tho, it's literally 1 command line.

    rustc main.rs
And I guess that's the wrap on how to create and compile a first Rust program.
Now come cargo! It seems it's a bit like npm for node. Use is pretty straightforward.
To create a project:

    cargo new project_name

It creates a _cargo.toml_ file, as configuration, and a /src folder where our main.rs file file is waiting for us.
We also have

    cargo check
    cargo run
    cargo build

to respectively check if the code compiles, if it runs properly and finally to compile it. Seems to be a good habit to do a lot of `cargo check` for validation before building.

## The guessing game code

```rust
    use std::io;

    fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }
```

Few things to observe here:

1. we use use `std::io;` as a dependency to accept the user's input
2. there is a `fn main {}` that encapuslates the code
3. there are `;` to end some lines (not all?)
4. lines are intended (reminds me of `GDScript`) after `io::stdin()`
5. `let mut guess = String::new();` creates a new **mutable variable** of type String.
6. So seems it means variables are constants per default.

```rust
let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
```

7. comments are made of `//` which is good
8. variable can be initiated with a type and `::new` such as in `String::new();`
9. `.read_line(&mut guess)` the `&mut guess` seems to indicate a **reference**, immutable per default but then mutable here
10. `.expect` seems to act an as error handling a bit as a return. Program would throw a warning at compilation without it.
11 In the `println` return, var is surrounded by `{}`

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);
```

Would return: `x = 5 and y + 2 = 12.`

So we can use `{}` as crab's bracket to send the value of the operation.

I'm adding `rand = "0.8.5"` to the _Cargo.toml_ file to add a **library crate**. It's like a dependency used in my **binary crate**. Here the goal is to create randomness, a bit like `Math.Random()` would act.

```rust
use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    loop {
    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => {
            println!("You win!");
            break;
        }
    }
}
}
