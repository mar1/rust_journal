# Day 1: Setup the beast

## Some setup things

As when any story starts, the future looks bright.
I started from the roots wit _The Rust Book_ chapters 1-2-3.
Installation is super simple on mac, to be honest. Just a simple one-liner:

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

Migh also need a C compiler by adding

    code-select --install
You can check if everything went smoothly by doing

    rustc --version

If you have troubles with your `%PATH%` after running the previous command (meaning rust is not recognized), please check this [stackoverflow's link.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67656028/rustup-gives-command-not-found-error-with-zsh-even-after-installing-with-brew)

Ok now we can create some `main.rs` file and put some code int it:

```rust
fn main() { println!("Hello, world!"); }
```

Hello, world! Nothing very surprising for the code above, expect the ! after the function's name. Actually, that's because `println` is not a function but a

> macro

I guess I learn more later about them.
Big things here coming from JS/Node is the compilation step. Not that big tho, it's literally 1 command line.

    rustc main.rs
And I guess that's the wrap on how to create and compile a first Rust program.
Now come cargo! It seems it's a bit like npm for node. Use is pretty straightforward.
To create a project:

    cargo new project_name

It creates a _cargo.toml_ file, as configuration, and a /src folder where our main.rs file file is waiting for us.
We also have

    cargo check
    cargo run
    cargo build

to respectively check if the code compiles, if it runs properly and finally to compile it. Seems to be a good habit to do a lot of `cargo check` for validation before building.

## The guessing game code

```rust
    use std::io;

    fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }
```

Few things to observe here:

1. we use use `std::io;` as a dependency to accept the user's input
2. there is a `fn main {}` that encapuslates the code
3. there are `;` to end some lines (not all?)
4. lines are intended (reminds me of `GDScript`) after `io::stdin()`
5. `let mut guess = String::new();` creates a new **mutable variable** of type String.
6. So seems it means variables are constants per default.

```rust
let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
```

7. comments are made of `//` which is good
8. variable can be initiated with a type and `::new` such as in `String::new();`
9. `.read_line(&mut guess)` the `&mut guess` seems to indicate a **reference**, immutable per default but then mutable here
10. `.expect` seems to act an as error handling a bit as a return. Program would throw a warning at compilation without it.
11 In the `println` return, var is surrounded by `{}`

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);
```

Would return: `x = 5 and y + 2 = 12.`

So we can use `{}` as crab's bracket to send the value of the operation.

I'm adding `rand = "0.8.5"` to the _Cargo.toml_ file to add a **library crate**. It's like a dependency used in my **binary crate**. Here the goal is to create randomness, a bit like `Math.Random()` would act.

```rust
use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    loop {
    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => {
            println!("You win!");
            break;
        }
    }
}
}
````

1. We now implemented the generation of the random number using `rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);`
2. We've done a loop only using `loop{}`
